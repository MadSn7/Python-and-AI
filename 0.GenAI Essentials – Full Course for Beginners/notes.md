## My Conlusion : Too Much Theory
## AI -> ML -> DL -> GenAI etc
- AI : Machines that perform jobs that mimic human behavior 
- ML : Machine that get better at a task without explicit programming(After model is created, it will work on it's own and improve)
- DL : Machines that have an artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems
- GenerativeAI(GenAI) : Subset of AI that generates out content, most time it will fit inside DL

## AI vs GenAI
- AI to simulate(Not emulate) human intelligence, so understading and decision making
- GenAI focuses on creating new data , interpret and analyzes old data to generate new ones.Has  Uses advanced ML techniques such as
    - GANs
    - VAEs
    - Transformer Models eg GPT
- LLMS which generate human-like text is subset of GenAI. GenAI has modalities like vision, text, audio, molcular(drig testing, discovery) etc. LLMs is in text part

## NLP(Natural Language Processing)
- Mix of Computer science and Linguistics
- Made up of  preprocessing text -> Language Understading(strunture/syntax) -> Processing & Functionality(Sentiment analysis etc)

## Regression
- Process of finding a function to correlate a labeled dataset into continuous variable.number, basically predict future values based on previous data set
- Different algos are there MSE, RMSE, MAE etc

## Classification
- Process of finding a function to divide a `labeled` dataset into classescategories
- Different Algos like logistic regression, Decision Tree/Random Forest, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, KNN etc

## Clustering
- Grouping `unlabeled` data bases on sumukaritites and differences
- Different Algos K-means, k-medooids, Heirarchial etc

## Types Of Machine Learning
- Many Types of ML
- Leaning Problems
    - Supervised : Labeled data
    - Unsupervised : unlabeled data
    - Reinforcement : an agent operates and
    then improves on feedback
- Hybrid Learning Problems
    - Semi-Supervised : few labeled and large no of unlabeled data
    - Self-Supervised
    - Multi-Instance

## Seems like too much theory focused
