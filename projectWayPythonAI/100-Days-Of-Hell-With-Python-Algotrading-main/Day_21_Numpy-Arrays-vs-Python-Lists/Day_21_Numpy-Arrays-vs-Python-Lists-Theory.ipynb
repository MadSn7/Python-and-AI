        "- This flexibility is useful for certain applications, but it comes at the cost of performance and memory efficiency. \n",
        "- In algorithmic trading, you might end up with lists containing mixed data types, which can lead to unexpected \n",
        "- behavior or errors during numerical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example**:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  prices_list = [100, 101.5, '102', 103.5]  # mixed data types: int, float, string\n",
        "  print(prices_list)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **NumPy Array**: NumPy arrays require all elements to be of the same data type. \n",
        "- This restriction enables NumPy to perform operations more efficiently because \n",
        "- it knows the exact type of each element and can use optimized C-based operations. \n",
        "- This is crucial in algorithmic trading where performance is key.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example**:\n",

        "- **Python List**: Python lists are slower for large-scale numerical operations because each element can be of any type, \n",

        "- making NumPy arrays highly efficient for large datasets, as commonly found in trading data.\n",

        "  prices_array = np.array([i for i in range(1000000)])\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "- **Python List**: Lists use more memory because they store type information and pointers for each element. \n",
        "-  This overhead can add up quickly with large datasets, making them less memory efficient for algorithmic trading data.\n",

        "- **Python List**: Python lists have limited built-in operations for numerical analysis. \n",

        "### 6. Multidimensional Data\n",
        "- **Python List**: Storing and manipulating multidimensional data (e.g., OHLC data) in Python lists requires nested lists, \n",
