A full-featured web application for backtesting moving average crossover trading strategies. Built with Python and Flask, this project demonstrates how to implement trading strategies using control flow concepts from Chapter 4 of [Practical Python for Effective Algorithmic Trading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3S8FQ7C).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Web Interface:** Modern, responsive design with Bootstrap 5
- **Strategy Customization:** Configure all aspects of your trading strategy
- **Real-time Visualization:** Interactive charts with Plotly
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Detailed performance metrics and trade history
- **Educational Tool:** Perfect for learning algorithmic trading concepts

## üî• Demo

Try the application live on Replit: [Stock Strategy Backtester](https://replit.com/@rathorekuldeeps/trading-strategy-backtester)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Flask 2.3.3+
- NumPy 1.25.2+
- pandas 2.1.0+
- Plotly 5.16.1+

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thekuldeepsingh/trading-strategy-backtester.git
   cd trading-strategy-backtester
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üîç Usage

1. **Configure Strategy Parameters**
   - Set the number of days to simulate
   - Adjust price volatility and starting price
   - Choose between Simple and Exponential Moving Averages
   - Set short-term and long-term MA periods
   - Configure initial capital and stop-loss percentage

2. **Run the Backtest**
   - Click "Run Backtest" to execute the simulation
   - View the results in the interactive dashboard

3. **Analyze Performance**
   - Check key metrics like total return, win rate, and drawdown
   - Examine the trade history for detailed analysis
   - Visualize price movements and portfolio value over time

## üìä Technical Implementation

The backtester is built on several core concepts from Chapter 4 of [Practical Python for Effective Algorithmic Trading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3S8FQ7C):

- **Conditional Statements:** Using if/elif/else structures to make trading decisions
- **Loops:** Using while loops to simulate day-by-day trading
- **Logical Operators:** Combining conditions to trigger buy/sell signals
- **Nested Control Structures:** Creating complex decision trees for trading logic

The web application extends these concepts with:

- **Flask Backend:** Provides API endpoints and serves web pages
- **Plotly Visualizations:** Creates interactive trading charts
- **Bootstrap Frontend:** Delivers a responsive, modern user interface
